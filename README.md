 # Sorting-Two-Array
Overview

The provided Java program allows the user to input elements into two separate arrays, sorts these arrays in different orders, and retrieves specific elements from each sorted array.

->Key Features

- User Input:
 

Prompts the user to enter the number of elements and the elements themselves for two arrays, A and B.
- Sorting:
  

Array A is sorted in ascending order.

Array B is sorted in descending order.

- Output:

Displays the sorted arrays.

Retrieves and displays the third smallest element from array A.

Retrieves and displays the second largest element from array B.

->Detailed Steps

- Initialization and User Input:


Input number of elements for array A and the elements themselves.

Input number of elements for array B and the elements themselves.

- Sorting Algorithms:
  

Array A (Ascending): Uses selection sort to sort in ascending order.

Array B (Descending): Uses selection sort to sort in descending order.

- Display Sorted Arrays:


Prints the sorted elements of array A.

Prints the sorted elements of array B.

- Retrieve Specific Elements:

1) Third Smallest Element in Array A:
   
Prints the third smallest element if the array has at least three elements.

2) Second Largest Element in Array B:

Prints the second largest element if the array has at least two elements.


This Java program demonstrates basic array handling, sorting, and user interaction in the console.
